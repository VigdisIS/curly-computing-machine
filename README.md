# Analyzing and comparing Twitter spheres through sentiment analysis and word frequency
Project for TDT4310 Intelligent Text Analytics and Language Understanding, Spring 2021. 

Tweets from five accounts from the Twitter spheres ‘eSports’, ‘NSFW’, ‘politicians’, 
‘scientists’ and ‘streamers’ are analysed through sentiment analysis and word frequency 
and compared to see if there are any correlations or contradictions across the spheres’ 
relations to each other.
