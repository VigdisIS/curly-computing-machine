RekklesLoL,"I'm sorry for unveiling like this on Twitter, but many times it feels like you guys are the closest I have after ""losing"" Fabian."
RekklesLoL,At this point I'm willing to try anything anyways so might as well give this a shot especially since it's worked before.
RekklesLoL,I spoke to one in the past during my school years when I was struggling in a similar fashion and it got me out of it.
RekklesLoL,I've decided that I'll seek help from a therapist. It should never go as far as it did last night.
RekklesLoL,"Gonna catch a couple hours of sleep now though, as you probably understood by now it's definitely needed. Thanks for being there."
RekklesLoL,"At least in between the Spring and Summer Split, even if missing out on another Worlds would be heartbreaking."
RekklesLoL,"I would never be able to live with myself if I were to give up now, but if things remain the same I might have to reconsider."
RekklesLoL,"Agreed with myself at the beginning of my career that I would end things on a high note, but health and happiness above all."
RekklesLoL,Not sure where to go from here other than the fact that I'll have to get through this. Just hope it's not going to tear me apart.
RekklesLoL,"Sadly it doesn't make it any easier, if anything it just makes things more complicated than they actually are."
RekklesLoL,Haven't been myself after my individual barrier got cracked in the beginning of the week so I guess it's understandable.
RekklesLoL,"I'm usually quite good at keeping myself together after tough losses, but tonight is not one of those days."

RekklesLoL,@G2Zven probably not &amp; ROX could've taken a different approach when he picked it up so early on
RekklesLoL,"@Jarge__ probably Dynamic, would be surprised if they ran a different system between the regions since we'll all have to same @ Worlds"
RekklesLoL,@G2Zven ROX would've if he picked any other AD though
RekklesLoL,@Jarge__ probably works against a worse team but I wouldn't consider KT one
RekklesLoL,"@Jarge__ which means that unless they manage to make plays &amp; get ahead, they'll end up slowly losing out"
RekklesLoL,@Jarge__ draft-wise I'd say they put themselves in a position where they're getting pressured/pushed in all 3 lanes
RekklesLoL,"@Jarge__ when it's GorillA playing it, yes"
RekklesLoL,"@Jarge__ unless Hachani is willing to pick up the Trundle himself, he's not left with much of a choice outside of Ezreal, Lucian &amp; Tristana"

RekklesLoL,"@Ceratius @Steeelb4ck @sOAZIZGOOD yes &amp; no, some champs demand more/less"
RekklesLoL,"@zzzhazza @Steeelb4ck @sOAZIZGOOD &amp; depends on champ, but I think it's a more legit stat than others"
RekklesLoL,@Steeelb4ck @sOAZIZGOOD so I agree on the dpm &amp; cs differece @ 10 part
RekklesLoL,"@Steeelb4ck @sOAZIZGOOD I think many of the stats that Riot highlights (KDA, CS/MIN, Kill%) aren't legit"
RekklesLoL,@Steeelb4ck @sOAZIZGOOD I'd much rather go for cs difference @ 10 in that case
